									<h2>Tier 3 Pro Player</h2>  									
									<div style="text-align: justify;">
									<p>Even though I was the last one of my friends that started playing League, my dedication and time spent learning and watching the pro scene 
										made me quickly stand out from them. Six months after starting playing league I reached Platinum Division, and the next season I was already Diamond. 
										The highlight brought too questions about entering championships and even going pro. Altought I had already played a battlefy tournament with my friends</p>

										<p>Even though I was the last one of my friends that started playing League, my dedication and time spent learning and watching the pro scene 
											made me quickly stand out from them. Six months after starting playing league I reached Platinum Division, and the next season I was already Diamond. 
											The highlight brought too questions about entering championships and even going pro. Altought I had already played a battlefy tournament with my friends, 
											the idea never made much of my mind as I thought a low diamond player couldn't achieve much.</p>
										<p>I kept grinding soloq games and watching the pro scene, and in 2016 I reached a solid Diamond 1 rank, which gave me confidence to try 
											going pro. I started safe, went to the League Boards recruitment and by the end of the day I was in a low Plat team.</p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/proplayer.png"/></span>
										<p>The guys didn't have much structure, and were more like a group of competitive players that wanted to grow. We trained for some days and in the first weekend,
											we were already competing in some Battlefy tournaments. We lost almost every game we played, and my teammates knew they weren't on the same level as me, 
											so they said to me quit the team to find a true organization. That's when I met <a href="https://lol.gamepedia.com/Kake" target="_blank">Kake</a> and 
											<a href="https://www.facebook.com/royalgamingOficial" target="_blank">Royal Gaming</a>.</p>
										<p>I don't even remember exacly how we met, but by the first minutes of the team selective I knew this was the real deal. 
											It was a full weekend of scrims, interviews and even soloq game analysis. Receiving the responde was as much anxiety as happines, 
											knowing that now I was in a true organization with staff, teams, streamers, etc.</p>
										<p>The first weeks of training was some real grind, as I learned a routine of playing, analysing, playing scrims and having a team feedback. The work was hard but really 
											rewarding, I saw my improvement and I loved the process, but it was a huge time cosuming activity, as we had 6 hours of team meeting + soloQ and solo training.</p>
										<p>We won several Battlefy tournaments, which at that time were really difficult as there was not a estabilished Tier 3 pro scene and a lot of pro players used to play in those camps</p>
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/redrex.png"/></span>
										<p>Ultimately, even though it was a fun and enriching experience, I decided to quit the team after my classes came back, because I wasn't having enough time for the team.</p>
										<p>Nowadays I feel proud to be once coached by one of the most requested coaches of the Brazilian lol scene, and to have incorporated Kake's teaching as a <a href="esports-redrex">team manager</a>.</p>
										<p>Even after five years, I still have the same <a href="https://battlefy.com/users/matheus-tambosi" target="_blank">Battlefy Account</a></p>
